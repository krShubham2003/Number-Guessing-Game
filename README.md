# Color Switcher

A simple and interactive Color Switcher web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to change the background color of the webpage by clicking on buttons representing different colors.

## Features

- **Dynamic Background Colors:** Change the background color of the page with a single click.
- **Interactive UI:** Hover effects and animations enhance the user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** The application works seamlessly across devices of different sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Provides the structure of the web page.
- **CSS:** Adds styling and hover effects to enhance the user interface.

## How It Works

1. The page displays buttons for four colors: grey, red, blue, and yellow.
2. Clicking on a button changes the background color of the page to the selected color.
3. Smooth transitions make the color-changing effect visually appealing.
